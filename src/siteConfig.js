  aboutLong: `
    I am an XR Developer energized by creating interactive, tangible, and intuitive
    experiences in VR and AR. For me, great XR is not only about technology, but
    especially about how users experience and feel a digital world. I prefer an
    iterative, prototype-driven approach: test quickly, refine, and test again —
    until interactions feel natural and enjoyable.
